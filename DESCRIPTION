Description: Provides helper functions to perform Bayesian model averaging
    using Markov chain Monte Carlo samples from separate models. Calculates
    weights and obtains draws from the model-averaged posterior for quantities
    of interest specified by the user. Weight calculations can be done using
    marginal likelihoods or log-predictive likelihoods as in Ando, T., & Tsay,
    R. (2010) <doi:10.1016/j.ijforecast.2009.08.001>.
